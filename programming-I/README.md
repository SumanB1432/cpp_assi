### <p align="center"> Programs include arrays, functions, loops, references, and conditional statements. </p>

* Short and simple programs in C++

* Making decisions (if, if..else, and switch statements) 

* Writing loops and nested-loops (while, do..while, and for loops)

* Declaring functions by inserting function prototypes and implementing pass-by-reference and return values
