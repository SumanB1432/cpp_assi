### <p align="center"> Programs include concepts from [programming-I](../programming-I) & [programming-II](../programming-II), focusing on software development practices, dynamic memory management, data structures, and code reusability. </p>

* Understand and employ good software development practices, such as structured design, efficient coding, and comprehensive testing

* Appreciate the benefits of dynamically allocated memory and demonstrate its effective use

* Develop, test, and use fundamental data structures including Lists, Stacks, and Queues

* Compare and critically evaluate the suitability of different data structures for specific applications

* Understand and apply the principles of code reusability through the use of templates

* Manage complex multi-file projects effectively
